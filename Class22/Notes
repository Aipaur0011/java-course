Why we should override a method?
     If a child class does not like the implementation of the parent class it has
     the flexibility that iut can override that method.

 Syntax of override?
     There must be a parent child relationship between two classes.

 Rules:
     1) To override a method there must be parent child relationship between two classes.
     2) If something can't be inherited we can't override it. For example private methods and
     constructors.
     3) Visibility of a method can be increased for example if something has default access
     or protected access we can make it public, but we can't make it private.
